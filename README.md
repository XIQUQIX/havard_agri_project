## Background Info:  
VegScape and CropScape are two USDA NASS web geospatial processing services that 
greatly facilitate remote sensing data accessing and processing, product data querying, 
visualizing, and disseminating. To learn more, read the papers about the VegScape and the 
CropScape web services for all functionalities. Together, the satellite image data pulled 
from these two web services can be used to produce crop phenology insights. Crop 
phenology is the study of the physiological stages of crop growth and development from 
planting, vegetative development, flowering, to harvest. It's a vital part of crop growth 
management and yield estimation, as it can be integrated with information about how 
environmental factors and management practices impact plant performance. See the 
panel diagram below to visualize the crop phenology for a field crop of potatoes

## Promt1
Crop phenology reports show the general trend of agricultural plant growth from 
satellite data; rising levels in the spring, peaking in the summer, and harvesting in the fall 
(drops off rapidly from Nov-Dec).

Currently, these two web services are not integrated, and there is no current capability to 
distinguish crop NDVI values from those NDVI values of natural vegetation. Your task is 
to create a scalable or parallel framework in Python or C++ that can integrate these two 
datasets over 23 counties from the Western United States, more details follow. These 
counties are located in the Western states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho and can be 
located in the map below.

These counties were chosen because they share a climate that is shaped by their position 
in the rain shadow of the Cascades Mountain Range, resulting in dry conditions, hot 
summers, and cold winters. The terrain is defined by rolling hills and valleys, and important 
river systems (Columbia and Snake Rivers) that enable irrigation-based, monoculture 
agriculture in an otherwise dry region. 

## Steps:
Our team developed a pipeline that executes the following steps:

Isolate the agricultural activity of the CropScape images based on the land 
classifications. You do not have to be so granular and separate by crop type. Just a 
binary, what is active agriculture and what is not.  

o Extract the NDVI values from similar areas from the VegScape images. 

o Create crop phenology time series (max, mean, min) NDVI dataframe reports per 
county over all years. Proceed to use a model of choice to analyze past trends 
and predict last year's (2023) crop phenology NDVI mean for all counties. We visualized 2023 prediction from one county, or a grouping of counties by 
state, of choice to the actual 2023 county data. 

o The competition wonâ€™t judge computational efficiency based only on whether your 
method uses parallelism. There are many scalable methods that don't use explicit 
parallelism but still handle large problems effectively. Think creatively about how 
your methods can scale up to handle larger problems. 

o The purpose of this exercise is to gain an understanding of the importance of crop 
phenology to assess food security in the American West, as well as being aware of 
an important vegetation index derived from satellite imaging.
