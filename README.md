## Background Info:  
VegScape and CropScape are two USDA NASS web geospatial processing services that 
greatly facilitate remote sensing data accessing and processing, product data querying, 
visualizing, and disseminating. To learn more, read the papers about the VegScape and the 
CropScape web services for all functionalities. Together, the satellite image data pulled 
from these two web services can be used to produce crop phenology insights. Crop 
phenology is the study of the physiological stages of crop growth and development from 
planting, vegetative development, flowering, to harvest. It's a vital part of crop growth 
management and yield estimation, as it can be integrated with information about how 
environmental factors and management practices impact plant performance. See the 
panel diagram below to visualize the crop phenology for a field crop of potatoes
